- programming languages


- Figure out how to host it on a server, github, or something that would allow to give people a link to my webpage
- Be able to wow Alistair and rest of team members



- Add Headers (Employment History, Education, etc)
- Have alignments match current resume
- Font sizes are funky - fix that
- consider some CSS
- make it look more like my resume
- Technical skills - do not make it into a list, change it into a blurb with commas
- create filter for specific job descriptions (front end, cloud, etc) and highlight the programming
- [free idea from Danny] For skills, hover over programming language and it shows comfort level with color coding

ProgrammingSkills = [java, python, c, golang, react]

for s in ProgrammingSkills:
	str = "Java"
	str = "Java" + "," + " Python"


printStr = ""
printStr += ProgrammingSkills[0]
for s in ProgrammingSkills[1:]:

	printStr += ", " + s
