            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I have a Master's in Computer Science as of May 2024 and am currently an intern
                at Sandia National Labs with an active Q (Top Secret) Clearance.
            <br>
            <br>
                Last summer, I started my opportunity to work for Sandia National Labs 
                as a TITANS summer intern (Technical Internships To Advance National Security).
                I worked on database management and created a database pruning mechanism
                that would automatically delete entries older than 30 days from a database.
            <br>
                My summer internship got extended into a year-round internship
                and I am now working on a database migration project where I am tasked with exporting data
                from a legacy database and importing that data into a new database.
                I have also recently obtained certification as an AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud Practitioner.
            <br>
            <br>
                Outside of computer science, I have a lot of hobbies.
                The hobby that is currently taking up most of my time is dancing.
                I currently take lessons at Sol Ballroom and know the basics of
                salsa, bachata, foxtrot, tango, cha cha, waltz, east coast swing, and west coast swing.
                Another thing I really enjoy is travelling. I've been to 14 different countries
                and visited 28 states in the USA.
